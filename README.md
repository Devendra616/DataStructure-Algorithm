# DataStructure-Algorithm
Data Structure and Algorithms implemented in Java Script and Java

This repository contains notes for important data structure and algorithms for interview practice.

## [Linear Search](./searching_traversing/search-linear.js)
Goes through each item of the array and check if the data exists.
    
**Time Complexity :**
- Best Case : O(1) When data exist at first index of the array
- Worst Case : O(n) When data exist at last index of the array or data not found

**Space Complexity :** O(1) no extra space required

## [Binary Search](./searching_traversing/search-binarySearch.js)
Works on an sorted array and uses the principle of Binary Search Tree.

**Time Complexity :**
- Best Case : O(1) When data exist at middle index of the array
- Worst Case : O(log n) 

**Space Complexity :** O(1) no extra space required
